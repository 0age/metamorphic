/**
 * @title Metamorphic Contract Factory
 * @author 0age
 * @notice This contract creates metamorphic contracts, or contracts that can be
 * redeployed with new code to the same address. It does so by deploying a
 * contract with fixed, non-deterministic initialization code via the CREATE2
 * opcode. This contract clones the implementation contract in its constructor.
 * Once a contract undergoes metamorphosis, all existing storage will be deleted
 * and any existing contract code will be replaced with the deployed contract
 * code of the new implementation contract.
 * @dev CREATE2 will not be available on mainnet until (at least) block
 * 7,280,000. This contract has not yet been fully tested or audited - proceed
 * with caution and please share any exploits or optimizations you discover.
